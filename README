This is a set of integral test suites for Sage based upon Tim Daly's work for Axiom see:

http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/CATS/

Copies of the ones used to develop the test suite are stored in the axiom_tests sub-directory. The tests check the integration via Sage to the Schaum's tabulated value of the integral. However, integrals which have more than one solution have no Schaum's result tabulated. These integrals will fail.     

Results of running these tests on my machine (OS X - Core 2 Duo 2.0GHz MacBook) are in the test_results directory.

Tickets for this test suite can be entered using the GitHub issues interface:

Note that this requires Sage 3.2 (because of the changes to timeit in that release) and the FriCAS optional package. For those who don't have FriCAS installed, just comment out the lines where axiom.integrate is called.
